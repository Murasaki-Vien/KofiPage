                <p>This is just a short website boss just to say my thank you. Bossing, thank you for everything starting from the beginning up until now. I really did not expect that we could last thinking that you are out of my league. But you still talked to me and I am really happy because of that. Michaella, I admit that I am not perfect but I could assure you that I will treat you, admire you, and care for you each and every day more than you think that you deserve. You're the risk that I'm willing to take. I hope what we started will grow and continue bossing.🥹</p>
                <p>Anyways, Goodluck on your Nursing journey. May the coming year of 2022 bring you more joy, prosperity, health, and blessings! Praying that you'll have a blissful year ahead. Life may not always go as planned, and when times get tough you can lean and rant on me anytime you want. Just always remember that as long as you want me to be with you then I'll be with you 24/7. Merry Christmas again and a happy new year to you and your family🎇.</p>
